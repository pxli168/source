  QUALITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
<p>7. Pre-release Product Additional Terms. If the product you have received with 
  this license is pre-commercial release or beta Software (&quot;Pre-release Software&quot;), 
  then the following Section applies. To the extent that any provision in this 
  Section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this Agreement, this 
  Section shall supercede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to 
  the Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. 
  You acknowledge that the Software is a pre-release version, does not represent 
  final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors and other problems that 
  could cause system or other failures and data loss. Consequently, the Pre-release 
  Software is provided to you &quot;AS-IS&quot;, and Adobe disclaims any warranty 
  or liability obligations to you of any kind. WHERE LEGALLY LIABILITY CANNOT 
  BE EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED, ADOBE'S LIABILITY 
  AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY DOLLARS (U.S. 
  $50) IN TOTAL. You acknowledge that Adobe has not promised or guaranteed to 
  you that Pre-release Software will be announced or made available to anyone 
  in the future, that Adobe has no express or implied obligation to you to announce 
  or introduce the Pre-release Software and that Adobe may not introduce a product 
  similar to or compatible with the Pre-release Software. Accordingly, you acknowledge 
  that any research or development that you perform regarding the Pre-release 
  Software or any product associated with the Pre-release Software is done entirely 
  at your own risk. During the term of this Agreement, if requested by Adobe, 
  you will provide feedback to Adobe regarding testing and use of the Pre-release 
  Software, including error or bug reports. If you have been provided the Pre-release 
  Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, such as the Adobe Systems 
  Incorporated Serial Agreement for Unreleased Products, your use of the Software 
  is also governed by such agreement. You agree that you may not and certify that 
  you will not sublicense, lease, loan, rent, or transfer the Pre-release Software. 
  Upon receipt of a later unreleased version of the Pre-release Software or release 
  by Adobe of a publicly released commercial version of the Software, whether 
  as a stand-alone product or as part of a larger product, you agree to return 
  or destroy all earlier Pre-release Software received from Adobe and to abide 
  by the terms of the End User License Agreement for any such later versions of 
  the Pre-release Software. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, 
  if you are located outside the United States of America, you agree that you 
  will return or destroy all unreleased versions of the Pre-release Software within 
  thirty (30) days of the completion of your testing of the Software when such 
  date is earlier than the date for Adobe's first commercial shipment of the publicly 
  released (commercial) Software.</p>
<p>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE 
  TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS WHATSOEVER OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT,

  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS OR COSTS OR 
  FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY 
  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN YOUR JURISDICTION. ADOBE'S AGGREGATE 
  LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT 
  SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY. Nothing contained 
  in this Agreement limits Adobe's liability to you in the event of death or personal 
  injury resulting from Adobe's negligence or for the tort of deceit (fraud). 
  Adobe is acting on behalf of its suppliers for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding 
  and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided in this Agreement, 
  but in no other respects and for no other purpose. For further information,
